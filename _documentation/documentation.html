      <li>Application paradigms;</li>
      <li>Structure of the application.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="technologies">3.1 Technologies</h3>

    <h4>For the development of the app, we will use:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        React Javascript library to build the user interface. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of
        individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile
        applications.
        Compared to other frontend technologies such as Angular or Vue.js that are considered frameworks, React is a
        library. React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually
        requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing. Redux and React Router are
        respective examples of such libraries.
      </li>
      <li>
        React-query: is a server-side state management tool, that gives out-of-the-box solutions for queries and
        mutations, cache manipulation, data refetching and many more
      </li>
      <li>
        Material-ui: is one of the top user interface frameworks for React out there. It gives developers a multitude of
        options, from text components, to grids, flexboxes, buttons, inputs, icons, and so on. It also gives developers
        the chance to create a custom CSS theme and use it across their apps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chart.js library in order to create the charts displayed in the app. Chart.js is a free and open-source
        JavaScript library for data visualization, which different types of charts: bar, line, area, pie (doughnut),
        bubble, radar, polar, and scatter. It is maintained by the community and is one of the most popular JS charting
        libraries on GitHub.
      </li>
      <li>
        Apisauce: a popular HTTP client that helps us create requests. Apisauce is a promise-based HTTP client that
        has an easy-to-use API and can be used in the browser. It also gives a standardized error format, for better
        handling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Node.js is a back-end runtime environment that executes JavaScript outside the browser
      </li>
      <li>
        Mongoose is an object data modeling tool based on MongoDB. It is a wrapper for the native MongoDB driver for the
        nodejs ecosystem. Helps developers with out-of-the-box solutions and eases the database development process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jsonwebtoken is a library that helps in encrypting and decrypting data, considered to be one of the standards in
        web applications
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div>
      <h3 id="api">3.2 API</h3>
      <p>
        The API, or the so called Application Programming Interface, is a collection of programming code that makes
        communication between applications possible. The API consists of 2 major components:
        The technical specifications that detail the data exchange between applications, stipulating specifications in
        the form of a request that is used for processing and data delivery protocols;
      </p>
      <p>
        A software interface that mirrors the specifications it represents.
        The way it happens is as follows: a software that needs access to a certain piece of information or
        functionality from another software, will call its API, by specifying the demands of how the data should be
        handed over. Finally, the called API will send back the data requested by the former application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, companies make APIs a priority of their applications and invest time to strategically construct their
        APIs. Their main goal is to grow their apps by improving and adding features, and have the APIs stay integral in
        using the product functionality. Taking the APIs seriously is one of the fastest ways to get value from data and
        evolving businesses all over the world have recognized that embracing APIs is imperative.
      </p>
      <p>
        The API that will be used for the application is <a href="https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3">CoinGecko</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        CoinGecko provides a broadened analysis of the cryptocurrency market. It tracks price, volume and market
        caps, and many more detailed information about the aforementioned. Their objective is to help
        crypto participants to understand the fundamentals of a given market. It currently tracks around 6000
        tokens from more than 400 cryptocurrency exchanges.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h4>In the development of the application we will use these endpoints:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>GET</strong> <i>/simple/price?ids=bitcoin, ethereum&vs_currencies=eur, usd</i>
        <strong>-></strong>
        Retrieves the current price of any cryptocurrencies in any supported currencies.
        It can take the following parameters: ids (passes a list of coins), vs_currencies (passes a list of currencies),
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>GET</strong> <i>/coins/${id}/market_chart?vs_currency=usd&days=1&interval=daily</i>
        <strong>-></strong>
        Retrieves historical market data including price, market cap, and 24h volume. It can take the

        <strong>GET</strong> <i>/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&ids=bitcoin</i> <strong>-></strong>
        Lists all supported coins prices, market caps, volumes, and market related datas. It can take many more
        parameters, like category, order, page or price_change_percentage, but for this application only 2 will be used:
        vs_currency (The target currency of market data) and ids (The ids of the coin, comma separated cryptocurrency
        symbols).
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      <h3 id="paradigms">3.3 Paradigms</h3>
      <p>
        Since the creation of React, the library has gone through significant changes. Nowadays there are three
        different ways of writing React, either using class components, functional components or a combination of both,
        each having their ups and downs. But lately, more and more React developers have switched to the functional
        components type of development, using React Hooks, since it makes the development process easier than the class
        components way. More than that, using functional components de-bloats the app as a whole, which makes it way
        faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, for the development of the app, we will use React Hooks, which uses the functional components approach.
        Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected problems in React that were encountered since the inception
        of the React library. Before hooks, it was hard to reuse stateful logic between components, but now, you can
        extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused in other components. So, in
        shorter words, creating our custom hooks helps us abstract logic and reuse it in other components.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 id="app-structure">3.4 App Structure</h3>
      <h4>Front-end</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The frontend application will be created using the create-react-app toolchain, that will set up the
          development environment, so that we can use the latest JavaScript features, and also optimize the app for
          production.
        </li>
        <li>
          The app will be developed as SPA (Single page application), having one big component, which usually is called
          App. From our App component, the rest of the application will stem, basically creating a tree of smaller
          components.
          For the first version of the application, we will have 3 main screens, the landing page, the markets page and
          the coin page, each displaying cryptocurrency related data in a different way.
          In later versions the app will have many more screens incorporated.
        </li>
        <li>
          As mentioned, we will be using Material-ui framework in order to create our components. To give our components
          a proper design we will make use of the styled components approach provided by this framework.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the data manipulation on the client-side, as mentioned before, we will use React-query.
          In order to abstract the logic of fetching all the coins related data we will be createting different types of
          hooks and will be used where it will be needed
        </li>
        <p>As of now, we don’t see any other structural or architectural need for the frontend of the application.</p>
      </ul>
      <img class="image" width="1100" height="550" src="./component_schema.png" />
      <h4>Back-end</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The backend part of the application will be a dedicated node.js server, using the express framework. This
          server will act as a proxy to the CoinGecko API and serve the data to the frontend app. The backend will be
          constructed as a multitiered application, having repository, service and controller layer, for a better
          understanding and modularity
        </li>
        <li>
          There will be around 8 endpoints that will be created, each serving different data in different circumstances.
          The planned routes will manipulate and transform the data received from the coinGecko API in order to give
          display it on the frontend easier.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Logo</h4>
      <h4>Our logo is represented by the following elements:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bitcoin symbol in the middle: the cryptocurrency is the currency around which the whole application revolves
          around and bitcoin, is by far the most known cryptocurrency on the market, its price having a huge impact on
          the crypto market. By displaying it’s symbol, we want to convey to the user the idea of power, which Bitcoin
          has plenty.
        </li>
        <li>
          Outside circle, which has 2 circular insertions on them: the outside circle represents the other currencies
          that orbit around bitcoin. These elements convey the idea of conversion. The 2 circular insertions positioned
          at opposite poles suggest the motivation for which the user is using the app, that of investing and obtaining
          a profit from currency trading.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img class="image" width="650" height="600" src="./cryma-logo.png" />
      <h4>Color Schema</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Orange: first of all, we chose this color, because it makes the user think of Bitcoin (orange being the
          Bitcoin primary logo color). Secondly, orange is a color that conveys the user the idea of wealthyness, since
          it makes the user think of gold. Since the main goal of our users is to make the most out of advantageous
          exchanges, this is an extremely important idea to transmit. In the third place, orange catches attention and
          signals safety (being common is warning signs). It also stimulates action, which makes it a great color to use
          for promoting activity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gray: in the interface of our application, gray is used to express professionalism and conventionality. Gray,
          associated with the gray hair of old age, suggests responsibility and formality, which are substantial values
          we want our app to suggest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Black: black is associated with power, being a grounding design element. We decided to mainly use it for
          typography, since it works well in combination with any other color.
        </li>
        <li>
          White: we used white within our application to create a minimalist and clean aesthetic. Alongside black, it’s
          a neutral color and if putting darker text over it, it makes everything much easier to read.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img class="image" width="700" height="600" src="./cryma-color-schema.png" />
      <h4>Typography</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          First of all, we chose Roboto as a text font for our application, because it’s clean and has an easy to read
          shape, in which the white spaces pioneer to form a sharp design.
        </li>
        <li>
          Secondly, its strokes create an elegant contrast, which makes the test easy to read. Lastly, it’s quite a
          comprehensive family font, which gained popularity on the web and makes it a great choice for web app designs.
        </li>
